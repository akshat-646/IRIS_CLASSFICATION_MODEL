**Iris Flower Classification**

A machine learning project to predict iris flower species based on physical measurements. The project focuses on implementing a complete ML workflow from data exploration to model evaluation using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

**Introduction**

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using their sepal and petal measurements. By leveraging Python's powerful machine learning and data visualization libraries, we explore the dataset characteristics, train a classification model, and evaluate its performance. The insights and methodology demonstrated here provide a solid foundation for understanding supervised machine learning concepts.

**Features**

**1.Data Loading and Exploration**: Loads the iris dataset and performs initial data exploration including shape, statistics, and species distribution.

**2.Data Visualization**: Creates comprehensive visualizations including scatter plots, box plots, and correlation analysis to understand feature relationships and class separability.

**3.Machine Learning Pipeline**: Implements complete ML workflow with proper train-test splitting, model training, and performance evaluation.

**4.Model Evaluation**: Provides detailed accuracy metrics, classification reports, and confusion matrix visualization to assess model performance.

**5.Prediction Demonstration**: Shows how to make predictions on new data points and interpret model confidence through probability scores.

**Technologies Used**

**1.Python**: The primary programming language for machine learning implementation.

**2.Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

**3.NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.

**4.Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, data splitting, and evaluation metrics.

**5.Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations and plots.

**6.Seaborn**: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

**Dataset**

The analysis is performed on the famous Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample belongs to one of three iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

**Usage**

Clone the repository or download the iris_classification.py file to your local machine.

Install the required libraries if you haven't already:
```
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

**Run the Python script:**
```
python iris_classification.py
```

The script will execute the complete analysis workflow and display results including data visualizations, model performance metrics, and prediction examples.
